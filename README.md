# 🛍️ End-to-End Data Analyst Project  
**Retail Customer Behavior Analysis (Python, SQL, Power BI)**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
A leading retail company wants to better understand customer shopping behavior to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty.  
The management team has noticed changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales channels (online vs. offline).  

They want to discover:  
- Which factors (discounts, seasons, payment preferences) influence customer decisions  
- Why customers return or churn  
- What drives repeat purchases  
- How to optimize marketing and product strategies  

This project analyzes the complete consumer behavior dataset and answers the key business question:

> **“How can the company leverage customer shopping data to identify trends, improve engagement, and optimize marketing & product strategies?”**

## 📂 Deliverables

### **1. Data Preparation & Modeling (Python)**
- Clean and transform raw datasets  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Use median instead of mean where needed (stable for outliers)  
- Prepare structured data for analysis  

### **2. Data Analysis (SQL)**
- Organize cleaned data into a relational format  
- Simulate business transactions  
- Run analytical SQL queries to uncover:  
  - Customer segments (New, Returning, Loyal)  
  - Discount impact on purchases  
  - Seasonal shopping trends  
  - Top product categories  
  - Factors influencing repeat purchases  

### **3. Visualization & Insights (Power BI)**
- Build an interactive dashboard displaying:  
  - Revenue trends  
  - Demographic insights  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Online vs. Offline performance  
  - Discount vs. purchase relationships  
- Helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions  


This part is done but i am not perpare full document so...
### **4. Report & Presentation**
- A clear project report summarizing  
  - Key findings  
  - Insights  
  - Actionable business recommendations  
- A visual presentation that communicates insights effectively  

### **5. GitHub Repository Structure**
📁 data/ → Raw & cleaned datasets
📁 notebooks/ → Python data preparation scripts
📁 sql/ → SQL queries
📁 dashboard/ → Power BI file (.pbix)
📁 reports/ → Final report & presentation
README.md → Project documentation


-----------------------------------------

## 🧠 Key Notes (Important Learnings)
- Always prefer **median** over mean when outliers exist  
- Median gives a **more realistic** representation of the central value  
- Always clean the dataset fully before analysis  
- Python → Clean data  
- SQL → Analyze data  
- Power BI → Visualize insights
